Global economic growth is subdued and could fuel more protectionism, according to a report released on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund.

In its October 2016 World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast global growth at 3.1 percent this year and 3.4 percent in 2017, the same as it predicted in July, shortly after Britain's vote to exit the European Union.

The pickup in 2017 will be driven mainly by emerging markets, the report said.

The outlook report marked down its growth prospects for advanced economies, while marking up those for the rest of the world. But 2017 prospects for both country groupings remain unchanged.

Taken as a whole, the world economy has moved sideways, said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist at the IMF, at a news briefing on Tuesday morning in Washington.

The IMF report expressed concern that persistent stagnation, particularly in advanced economies, could further fuel populist calls for restrictions on trade and immigration. Obstfeld said such restrictions would hamper productivity, growth and innovation, citing the examples of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the anti-trade rhetoric of the US presidential campaign trail. Such things create uncertainty for investors, he said.

It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration, he said. Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy's current doldrums.

The IMF predicts that China's economy, the world's second-largest, would grow 6.6 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2017, down from 6.9 percent last year.

It said policymakers in China will continue to shift the economy away from reliance on investment and industry toward consumption and services, a policy that is expected to slow growth in the short term while building a foundation for sustainable long-term expansion.

But it said the government should take steps to rein in credit that is increasing at a dangerous pace and cut off support for nonviable State-owned enterprises. China should accept the associated slower GDP growth, the report said.

The IMF also forecast that India's GDP would expand 7.6 percent this year and next, the fastest pace among the world's major economies.

It forecast the growth of emerging markets and developing economies to speed up this year for the first time in six years, to 4.2 percent, slightly higher than the July forecast of 4.1 percent.

Collapse of Moon Gate raises questions of best ways to safeguard icon


The recent collapse of the Great Walls Moon Gate ¡ª a well-known landmark in Guangwu, Shanxi province ¡ª has put protection of the wall into the limelight a second time in a few weeks.

The gate, which was already suffering decay, was part of an old watchtower. It apparently collapsed on Monday night. Local authorities have yet to make an official statement.

Environmental degradation, mining, construction and brick theft are the main reasons for the walls decay, according to local geologists. In recent years, poor repair efforts have also taken a toll.

Exactly how to repair or protect wall sections became the subject of heated public debate recently after a stretch of 780 meters of wild, or original, wall dating to the 14th century was covered in white cement under orders from the cultural relics bureau of Suizhong county in Liaoning province.

The preservation approach drew a sharp backlash when it became public last month.

Dong Yaohui, deputy director of the Great Wall Society of China, an organization dedicated to the preservation and protection of the wall, said the restoration work had been done very poorly.

It damaged the authentic look of the Great Wall and took away its history from the people, he said.

Like that wall section in Liaoning, the stretch in Shanxi was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and served as a key historical and cultural reference when Beijing repaired its own sections.

Wild sections of the wall are usually located in remote rural areas.

They have been hammered by hundreds of years of storms, and local villagers have used their bricks for construction, making the structures unsuitable for ordinary tourists to enjoy, unlike Beijings world-renowned Badaling and Juyongguan Great Wall sections.

In 2006, the Great Wall Protection Ordinance was passed by the State Council, Chinas Cabinet, to improve protection and strengthen regulation. After 10 years, however, many parts of the wall remain structurally compromised, especially in areas where tourists dont go, said Wu Guoqiang, the societys secretary-general.

Wu said a lack of detailed procedures and renovation standards are at the root of lackluster repairs, but these criteria take time to be established. Consequently, Wu said that a special foundation for Great Wall protection should be established. He also emphasized the use of modern technology.

If we can use 3D modeling and virtual reality technologies to map out bricks and cracks in the Great Wall, it will improve the quality of restoration, he said.

On Monday, the relics bureau in Suizhong, Liaoning, hired two dozen local farmers to erect concrete pillars and string wire fencing to discourage tourists from climbing on the wall, which could be dangerous, said Liu Chunhua, the bureaus deputy chief.

Liu Fusheng, the Yongan Zhuishan forest management director in Suizhong, claimed he helped to raise more than 5 million yuan (750,000) over the past 13 years to protect the local wall section and possibly turn it into a tourist attraction for backpackers. His efforts were wasted, he said, when the wall was turned into pavement.

It is like losing the ears, nose and all the other features of a face, he said.
